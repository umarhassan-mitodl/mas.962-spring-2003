S. Papert - Foundational Work
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Short paper: The short foreword to _Mindstorms_, called [The Gears of My Childhood](http://www.papert.org/articles/GearsOfMyChildhood.html), has been very influential in the work of constructionist learning and education researchers. Write a short first reaction to this piece. I am only looking to see what emotions it evokes in you and how your thoughts and feelings about the central points of this piece evolve as you read the rest of _Mindstorms_.

Short Papers
------------

As indicated on the course schedule, each student will write a short paper (2-3 pages) on each reading. See the course schedule for details.

Final Project
-------------

In small groups (or individually), students should select a part of the body of constructionist learning research. The goal of the project is to give a thoughtful overview of what is known that would be accessible to a much broader audience.

You should in particular highlight the contributions -- in methodology, activity, and/or tools -- that this body of research has made to our understanding of the power of powerful ideas, how we learn, and the factors that influence the learning process. You should also discuss any contributions to designing education strategies and activities. The analysis should make use of the themes and issues discussed in the course; it should include a critical analysis of how contexts (communities and cultures), choice of tools, activities, and support materials enable learners to develop an ownership of and gain fluency in using powerful ideas. Examples include the contructionist research on learning mathematics, science, or engineering.

Final Paper and Web Site
------------------------

Your findings should be reported in a 20 page paper and a Web site.

Final Class Presentation
------------------------

Each group write prepare a final paper and Web site and make an in-class presentation about it in the last week of class.
